My name is Daniel Woods, and I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University.  My main areas of research are in Experimental and Behavioral Economics, and I am also interested in Computational Economics and Industrial Organization.  

I am on the academic job market in the 2020-2021 season.  I will be interviewing remotely at any interested party's convenience.

My Job Market Paper, [Improving Ex-ante Power Analysis With Quantal Response Simulations](https://woodsd42.github.io/files/JMP.pdf), proposes and explores a novel method of power analysis for economics experiments.  

Feel free to check out my CV and Research, or to contact me [via email](mailto:woods104@purdue.edu).



I am affiliated with the [VSEEL experimental lab](https://krannert.purdue.edu/centers/vseel/) at Purdue University.
